# google-calendar-economic-events

### Description
**_version 1_** 

An app that collects economic calendar events via APIs, loads them into an embedded Google Calendar, and allows visitors to download/access the public calendar.

**_version 2_** 

After difficulty finding a free API for an Economic Calendar, the project has pivoted to Earnings Calendar applications. The same concept holds, but the app now pulls earnings announcements rather than economic data announcements.

### Current Goal
Assess to see if the v1 Economics Calendar is still unviable (as this is the preferred model), and review the current code to see where we are and what's next.
