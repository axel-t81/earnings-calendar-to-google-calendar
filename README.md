# google-calendar-economic-events
v1 A small website that collects economic calendar events via an API, loads them into an embedded Google Calendar, and allows visitors to download/access the public calendar

v2 After finding it difficult to find a free API for an Economic Calendar, the project has pivoted to an Earnings Calendar where I was able to find a free API.
